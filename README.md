#What is SJWCoin?  

SJWCoin is like Bitcoin,and based on TacoCoin. It is an scrypt based cryptocurrency.
I picked TacoCoin because of them being pioneers in scrypt merge mining (as far as I can tell) and this coin will sure as the fuck need
that to get any sort of traction because who the fuck really needs yet another coin?  really..

#Why SJWCoin?

Cause why the fuck not, I say.  Or ask?  It does kind of look like a question.  You fucking decide.
